Hello all lovers of PHP and JavaScript. As most I am self-taught and I encourage you to contribute in je5. I'm adding to Je5, little by little, functions and classes that come up in the projects I'm doing. But every time is bigger and I think that with your help we can do something great. The idea is to simplify tools to add to any project with a few lines.
